# 1D-Skew-Sculptor-Studio
Skew Sculptor Studio is an expert-level exotic derivatives pricing and volatility surface modeling platform.
The project focuses on pricing complex option structures, constructing implied volatility surfaces, and decoding market-embedded probability distributions through advanced quantitative models.

The platform combines exotic option pricing, Monte Carlo simulation, finite difference methods, and volatility surface analytics to study skew dynamics and market sentiment.

Project Details

Project Name: Skew Sculptor Studio

Duration: 15 Days

Difficulty Level: Expert

Development Mode: Rapid AI-assisted prototyping

Core Objectives

Price exotic derivatives accurately under varying market conditions

Model volatility smiles and skews across maturities and strikes

Extract implied probability distributions from volatility surfaces

Analyze smile dynamics and market sentiment

Build visualization tools for surface inspection and mispricing detection

Technical Scope
1. Exotic Option Pricing Models

Asian options (arithmetic & geometric averaging)

Lookback options (fixed & floating strike)

Barrier options (knock-in / knock-out structures)

2. Numerical Methods

Monte Carlo simulation with variance reduction

Finite Difference Methods (Explicit, Implicit, Crank-Nicolson)

Convergence and stability analysis

3. Greeks & Sensitivity Analysis

Delta, Gamma, Vega, Theta, Rho

Pathwise and likelihood ratio methods

Sensitivity analysis under skew shifts

4. Model Calibration

Calibration to implied volatility surfaces

Parameter optimization using market data

Smile and skew consistency checks

Volatility Surface & Skew Analytics

Volatility smile and skew mechanics

Surface interpolation and smoothing

Implied distribution extraction

Local volatility model implementation

Smile dynamics under changing regimes

Game Concept & Learning Narrative

You play the role of a volatility sculptor, shaping volatility surfaces that encode market psychology.
By manipulating skew and smile structures, you uncover hidden expectations, identify mispricings, and design strategies to trade volatility itself.

The game trains intuition for how market sentiment, tail risk, and demand-supply imbalances distort volatility surfaces.

Core Game Mechanics

Interactive volatility surface visualization

Skew and smile pattern identification challenges

Model parameter tuning and optimization

Mispricing detection through surface deformation
